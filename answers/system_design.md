# System Design Overview

**Objective:** Design a system capable of handling high volumes of traffic and ensuring low latency, focusing on backend infrastructure and data flow.

### Projects:

- Chat based application [ touku ]
- Project management based application [ RMB, Safeex ]
- Crypto currency based project like [ Xana ]

## Architecture Components

1. **Load Balancer:**

   - **Role:** Distributes incoming traffic evenly across multiple servers.
   - **Implementation:** Used services like AWS Elastic Load Balancing (ELB) or NGINX.
   - **Scalability:** Can automatically scale to handle increased traffic by adding more servers.
2. **Application Servers:**

   - **Role:** Process user requests and handle business logic.
   - **Implementation:** Deploy multiple stateless microservices using containers (Docker) orchestrated by Kubernetes.
   - **Scalability:** Horizontal scaling by adding more instances of microservices as traffic increases.
3. **Database Layer:**

   - **Role:** Store and manage data.
   - **Implementation:**
     - **Primary Database:** Used a distributed SQL database like postgres, a NoSQL database like mongodb or graph based data like AWS Neptune db.
     - **Caching Layer:** Implement Redis or Memcached to cache frequently accessed data, reducing database load.
   - **Scalability:** Partitioning (sharding) and replication strategies for distributed databases.
4. **Content Delivery Network (CDN):**

   - **Role:** Distribute static content (images, CSS, JS files) globally.
   - **Implementation:** Used services like Cloudflare or AWS CloudFront.
   - **Scalability:** Automatically scales to deliver content with low latency by caching it closer to users.
5. **Message Queues:**

   - **Role:** Decouple services and ensure smooth data flow.
   - **Implementation:** Used AWS SQS for message queuing.
   - **Scalability:** Supports high-throughput messaging, enabling asynchronous processing.
6. **Autoscaling Groups:**

   - **Role:** Automatically adjust the number of running instances based on traffic.
   - **Implementation:** Configure autoscaling policies in AWS, Google Cloud, or Azure.
   - **Scalability:** Ensures that resources scale up during peak times and scale down during low traffic periods.

## Ensuring High Scalability and Low Latency

1. **Stateless Microservices:**

   - Designed services to be stateless, allowing any instance to handle any request, enabling easy horizontal scaling.
2. **Database Optimization:**

   - Used read replicas to offload read operations.
   - Implement indexing and query optimization.
   - Used eventual consistency for non-critical data.
3. **Caching Strategy:**

   - Cache database query results, API responses, and static content for notification funtionality in safeex project.
   - Implement cache invalidation strategies to ensure data freshness.
4. **Monitoring and Alerts:**

   - Used monitoring tools like Prometheus, Grafana, and CloudWatch.
   - Set up alerts for key performance metrics (CPU usage, response time, error rates).
5. **Load Testing:**

   - Regularly perform load testing using tools like Apache JMeter or Locust.
   - Identify and address bottlenecks before they impact users.

## Data Flow

1. **User Request:**

   - User request hits the load balancer.
   - Load balancer routes the request to an available application server.
2. **Processing Request:**

   - Application server processes the request, fetching data from the cache or database as needed.
   - Business logic is executed, and the appropriate response is generated.
3. **Data Storage:**

   - Data is written to the database with appropriate consistency and durability settings.
   - Asynchronous tasks are queued using message queues for later processing.
4. **Response Delivery:**

   - Response is sent back to the user via the load balancer.
   - Static assets are delivered via the CDN.

By implementing these strategies and components, the system can handle high traffic volumes and maintain low latency, ensuring a robust and scalable backend infrastructure.
